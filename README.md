# Gorillas-Game: Modern Rendition

This modern rendition of the classic Gorillas Game engages two-players, the participants strategically throw bombs at each other while skillfully evading the buildings that stand between them. The objective? Be the first to hit your opponent and claim victory!

What sets this version apart is its intuitive controls: players can drag and aim their throws using the mouse, adding a layer of precision and immersion that enhances the gameplay experience. Unlike the original where the players must type the values. Now, your every move is controlled with a simple, yet dynamic, mouse gesture.

Immerse yourself in the fun of the original game, elevated with modern convenience and gameplay mechanics
